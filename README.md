# Members Only

This is my submission for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-members-only)'s members_only project. This project uses Devise a popular authentication gem to authenticate users who can create posts and see who created posts. Users who are not signed in can see the posts but cannot see who the author is.
